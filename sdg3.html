                fundamental to sustainable development. Health challenges such as pandemics, maternal and 
                child mortality, and mental health disorders continue to strain communities and systems. 
                Universal access to quality healthcare, essential medicines, and preventive services is 
                crucial. Building resilient health systems and promoting mental and physical well-being 
                are key steps toward achieving equity and enabling individuals to thrive in all aspects of life.</p>
            <h2 id="sdg3-title">Good Health and Well-being</h2>
            <p id="sdg3-description">Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) aims to ensure healthy lives and 
                promote well-being for all at all ages. While significant progress has been made in 
                reducing child mortality and fighting diseases, challenges like healthcare access, 
                pandemics, and mental health issues persist. SDG 3 targets include reducing maternal 
                and child mortality, combating epidemics, ensuring universal health coverage, and 
                promoting mental health and well-being. It also stresses the importance of access to 
                essential medicines, vaccines, and healthcare services. Good health is foundational to 
                personal and societal development. By investing in strong health systems, education, and 
                preventive care, communities can thrive and individuals can reach their full potential.</p>
