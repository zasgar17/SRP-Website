                development. Around the world, many children and adults still lack access to basic education, 
                limiting their potential and opportunities. Ensuring free, inclusive, and high-quality learning 
                environments helps break the cycle of poverty and supports social mobility. By promoting lifelong learning, 
                improving literacy and skills, and addressing inequality, we can empower individuals and build stronger, 
                more just societies.</p>
            <h2 id="sdg4-title">Quality Education</h2>
            <p id="sdg4-description">Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG 4) seeks to ensure inclusive and equitable quality 
                education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. Education is a powerful tool for breaking the 
                cycle of poverty and creating opportunities. SDG 4 targets include universal access to free primary and 
                secondary education, equal access to affordable technical, vocational, and higher education, and improvement 
                in literacy and numeracy skills. It also focuses on eliminating gender disparities and promoting education 
                for sustainable development. Quality education fosters innovation, civic engagement, and economic growth. 
                By empowering learners of all ages, this goal helps build resilient, inclusive societies where everyone has 
                the tools to succeed.
