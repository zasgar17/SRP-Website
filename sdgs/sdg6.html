                human dignity, and environmental sustainability. Yet, billions of people still live without safe drinking 
                water and basic hygiene services. Achieving SDG 6 means building resilient water systems, improving 
                sanitation infrastructure, and protecting water-related ecosystems. Clean water is not only a basic human 
                rightâ€”it is also key to health, education, gender equality, and sustainable development. With innovation, 
                investment, and cooperation, a future with safe water for all is possible.</p>
            <h2 id="sdg6-title">Clean Water and Sanitation</h2>
            <p id="sdg6-description">Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) aims to ensure availability and sustainable management 
                of water and sanitation for all. Clean water is essential for health, survival, and dignity, yet billions still 
                lack safe water and proper sanitation. SDG 6 targets include achieving universal access to safe drinking water, 
                improving water quality, increasing water-use efficiency, and protecting water-related ecosystems. 
                It also promotes the importance of hygiene and equitable sanitation facilities. Water is a human right 
                and a cornerstone of public health. Ensuring clean and accessible water for all supports better health, 
                gender equality, and sustainable development. Reaching this goal requires infrastructure, innovation, 
                and global cooperation.</p>
