            <p class="sdg-intro">Ending poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest 
                challenges facing humanity. Despite progress, millions still live in extreme poverty. 
                Sustainable economic growth, social protection, and equal opportunities are vital for 
                addressing this global issue.</p>
            <h2>Reduced Inequalities</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 10 (SDG 10) focuses on reducing inequalities within and among countries, 
                addressing disparities in income, opportunities, and access to essential services. 
                Economic inequality has widened globally, with wealth concentrated in the hands of a few while 
                marginalized communities struggle with poverty and exclusion. SDG 10 aims to promote social, economic, 
                and political inclusion by tackling discrimination based on age, gender, disability, race, 
                and migration status. It also emphasizes the importance of fair wages, equal access to education and healthcare, 
                and financial policies that support lower-income populations. Beyond national efforts, the goal highlights 
                the need for improved representation of developing countries in global decision-making. By ensuring fair and 
                equitable systems, SDG 10 helps create a more stable and prosperous world where no one is left behind. 
                Reducing inequality leads to stronger societies, greater innovation, and more inclusive economic growth.</p>
