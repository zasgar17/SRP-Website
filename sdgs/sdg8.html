                and a path to a better life. Yet, many people around the world face unemployment, job insecurity, 
                or unsafe conditions. SDG 8 focuses on promoting inclusive economic growth by ensuring decent work, 
                supporting innovation, and creating opportunities for all. Sustainable economies depend on productive jobs, 
                fair wages, and safe workplaces. When people have access to meaningful employment, communities thrive and 
                prosperity becomes possible for everyone.</p>
            <h2 id="sdg8-title">Decent Work and Economic Growth</h2>
            <p id="sdg8-description">Sustainable Development Goal 8 (SDG 8) promotes sustained, inclusive, and sustainable 
                economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. In a rapidly changing global 
                economy, many face unemployment, underemployment, or poor working conditions. SDG 8 targets include 
                promoting youth employment, ensuring safe work environments, supporting entrepreneurship, and reducing 
                the informal labor market. It also emphasizes sustainable tourism, innovation, and fair global labor 
                practices. Decent work empowers individuals and drives economic resilience. By creating job opportunities 
                and fostering inclusive economic policies, SDG 8 supports prosperity that benefits everyone.</p>
