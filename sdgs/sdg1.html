            <p id="sdg1-intro" class="sdg-intro">Poverty remains one of the most pressing global challenges. 
                While progress has been made, millions still struggle to meet basic needs and live with dignity. 
                Ending poverty means more than increasing income—it requires access to education, healthcare, 
                social protection, and equal opportunities. By creating inclusive systems and supporting the most vulnerable, 
                we can build a future where no one is left behind.</p>
            <h2 id="sdg1-title">No Poverty</h2>
            <p id="sdg1-description">Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere.
                While global poverty rates have declined over the years, millions of people still live in extreme poverty, 
                struggling to meet basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare. SDG 1 targets include eradicating 
                extreme poverty, ensuring access to social protection systems, and building resilience to economic, social, 
                and environmental shocks. Poverty is not just about lack of income—it’s also about exclusion, inequality, 
                and vulnerability. Achieving this goal means investing in education, job opportunities, and fair economic 
                growth. It also requires coordinated action from governments, businesses, and communities to create inclusive 
                systems that leave no one behind. Ending poverty is the first step toward a more equitable and sustainable 
                world.</p>
