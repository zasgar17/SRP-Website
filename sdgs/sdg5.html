            <p class="sdg-intro">Ending poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest 
                challenges facing humanity. Despite progress, millions still live in extreme poverty. 
                Sustainable economic growth, social protection, and equal opportunities are vital for 
                addressing this global issue.</p>
            <h2>Gender Equality</h2>
            <p>Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5) aims to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. 
                Despite progress in recent years, gender discrimination remains deeply rooted in many societies, 
                limiting access to education, employment, and decision-making roles. SDG 5 targets include eliminating 
                gender-based violence, ensuring equal opportunities in leadership, and recognizing unpaid care work. 
                Additionally, it seeks to end child marriage and female genital mutilation while promoting reproductive rights. 
                Gender equality is not just a fundamental human right but also essential for sustainable development. 
                When women and girls have equal access to resources and opportunities, economies grow, and communities thrive. 
                Achieving this goal requires strong policies, social change, and collaboration across governments, 
                organizations, and individuals. By fostering an inclusive society where everyone—regardless of 
                gender—can reach their full potential, SDG 5 paves the way for a more just and prosperous world.</p>
